Basic plan

Follows a system of echolocation based navigation using a visual map of echolocation based visuals.

The player progresses through the maze, locating different parts of the eye from different parts of the Map.
The player then finds a surviving doctor that implants the eyes in the player and restores their sight?? - convert to top down shooter to clear the maze?

Potentially create an endless mode using procedural generation and have each of the quadrants (+ expansions??) as different "biomes"



True Player Character System:
- No flashlight or light sources of any kind

- Two walking modes: Slow walk and sprint

- Slow walking moves the player forward at a slower pace, but does not trigger any audio illumination or enemy detection
    however, it causes the removal of visual audio cues of enemies (spatial audio still appears, however)

- Sprinting moves the player forward at full speed. Each step illuminates the area around them in a circular radius about 3x the player's hitbox. 
    Visual audio cues appear during this. Enemies are alerted to your position while running.

- The player can shout loudly to illuminate a larger area that ever so slightly penetrates walls. 
    This can only be done while not moving, and requires the player to stand still for a few seconds while doing so. 
    The shout also alerts enemies in a much larger radius to the player's position.

Enemy Systems:
- All enemies are blind
- Path to the player upon hearing footsteps (IF IN RANGE)
- Develop pathfinding system (Or attempt to integrate ai system)
- Enemies run from and actively path away from flashlight at any opportunity to elevate suspense
- Player shout ability will cause enemies to rush in at a faster pace depending on their distance from the player.
- Enemies are always slightly faster than the player to promote tactical avoidance (hiding behind walls and walking at important moments)
- Perhaps an enemy that does more ambush type movement and does not emit sound unless moving could be cool.
    Give Jack credit for that one




Map changes ideas
- Basic central area - contains four quadrants that lead to different parts of the Maze
- Quadrant 1 - top area:
    Maze remains the same but enemy spawns increase drastically leading to the player needing to play more carefully.
    All improved enemy types can spawn here
- Quadrant 2 - middle left:
    Maze becomes more angular and jagged. Enemies move faster and are more effective at hearing the player
    If I decide to implement a health system, these enemies will do more damage than normal 
- Quadrant 3 - middle right:
    Maze becomes more focused on misdirection and change. Certain walls will occasionally change positions
    Enemy types in this area will move slower and make less noise, as well as no longer illuminating their footsteps OR utilise Jack's ambush enemy ideas
- Quadrant 4 - bottom:
    This maze becomes significantly more streamlined and enemies spawn in varied locations across the lesser winding paths
    This maze will also contain more basic blockages, e.g. boxes blocking half a pathway rather than a full one.
    Boxes reveal themselves at close range and the player is able to gather eye parts from these boxes.
